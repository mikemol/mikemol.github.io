## Up Front

I'm going to call out that there will be spoilers. There have to be; I've read this series multiple times, and my observations are based on that. Be warned. Also note, while I was searching around to fill out some details I could only vaguely remember, I discovered the fantastic [The Dragera Timeline](http://www.panix.com/~alexx/dragtime.html), which is worth checking out if you're into super-detailed in-depth analysis well beyond what I'm trying for here. In case that page vanishes, it's [also over on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220319145849/http://www.panix.com/~alexx/dragtime.html).

## Preface

The preface is written in-universe. I love this; it immediately puts forward the idea that the story and setting are bigger than you're going to see, since you already know you're looking at it through a particular viewport. As a device, I feel like that gives the setting the impression of depth, whether or not the context gaps are ever filled in.

This preface also establishes the long-winded nature of the book. And I love that, too. (Though I can only stomach it as an audiobook; trying to read it, my eye just skims over it. As audio, though, it's hilarious.) This sentence from the preface is pretty representative of the tone of the rest of the book:

> Yet Master Vrei, who happened to see the notebook one day while we discussed the volumes in question, and read it on the spot, announced that, by itself, it would, if not provide an accurate look at certain aspects of court life before the Interregnum, at least be a possible source of, in his words, “enlightened entertainment.”

What makes this even better is that sentence is in the context of the book being *shorter and less precise* than it might have been; in-setting, the proper form of the book would have been even *more* long-winded. Maybe this is a dig on historical literature in the real world? I haven't read enough to know. The general tone of the book is *definitely* a dig on pompous academics. Think the professors from *Dead Poets Society*, or John Cleese's character from *Monty Python*'s cheese shop sketch.

There's also a translator's note in the preface that's worth mentioning:

> Translator's Note: The Dragaeran language uses the symbol "gya" to represent someone of unknown sex. Since English lacks this convenience, I have decided to use the word "he" for all such occurences. -- S.B.

I want to point out that, yes, the English language has a word for a person of unknown sex (or gender). That word is "they."

"S.B." is Steven Brust, the actual author of the Dragera books, and I enjoy the [Framing Device](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice?from=Main.FramingStory) of the book is written and presented as though it isn't the original, but instead a transformation of another work. This particular window into another world is revisited twice more (that I can remember) in the Vlad Taltos books, too. I think one of them was *Dragon*, but I'm not sure. To be clear, though, this framing is lifted *straight* out of *The Three Musketeers*, of which *The Phoenix Guards* is a direct reinterpretation. Seriously, go read [the Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers#Origin).

There's an interesting line in here, "While the notion of a reticent Tiassa is startling enough--"; it's interesting since you don't understand what a Tiassa *is* until you've read through the first several chapters, or unless you've read other Dragera books that include characters like The Blue Fox and Piro. So here we have an aside that's almost an indirect [As You Know](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow). This continues with the author's description of their process tracking down their sources of their work, including notes of events that wouldn't happen for 500 years or more in-setting.

One thing that's pretty slick here in the preface is something you won't notice unless you consume the book in two different forms:

> We must beg our readers' indulgence...

That's what it reads in print. If you're listening via an audiobook, it will say "We must beg our *listeners'* indulgence. This is played with even more in a later book of the Vlad Taltos series, where Vlad mentions that he's talking to the listener "via a little recording box." You can bet that's captured differently in the print form.

The preface ends with the name of the in-universe Author (Paarfi) and the date "309 (2/1/2/3)". The date means absolutely nothing if you aren't familiar with the calendar system, which I think is first explained in a book which takes place around a thousand years later, and is deeply rooted in the cosmology and metaphysics of the setting. The [calendar system](https://www.panix.com/~alexx/dragtime.html#Calendar) is complicated, but unfortunately inconsistent across the series. So, good for flavor, bad for precision. I won't try to reproduce it here.

Incidentally, I *love* the structure and framework a good cosmology provides a setting. Whether it's *Dragera*, *The Elric Saga* or *Discworld*, a good cosmology can easily make the world feel much more expansive.

## Book One, Chapter the First

This section is going to be long, since there's so much setting and device exposition happening in it for the first time. I should be able to skip over repeats of that pattern, but we've got to touch on them at least once.

> It happened that on the sixth day of spring, in the first year of the reign of His Imperial Majesty Tortaalik I of the House of the Phoenix...in the village of Newmarket, some sixty leagues from Dragera City.

Great. The first sentence in a chapter, and I already want to unpack it. Hopefully this gets easier as the book progresses. Anyway, several things about the setting's culture are immediately introduced. First, dates are counted from season. From a meta perspective, I don't know if that's just a convenience to not have to be more mechanical about it, if it's done for flavor reasons, or both, but the cultural flavor is neat. (Are there books that catalog tropes around assembling fictitious cultures? I'd love to read those.)

Second, we're told up front this is an empire-based government, some basic honorifics around that, and that a system of peerage and nobility is in place.

Third, we learn that people think in terms distance-from-the-big-city, and we learn up front that The City is Dragera City.

After that quote, we're told about the origin of the name of a tavern and the locale's relevance to some event in history. *This is in no way important for the rest of the series or any other book in the setting.* It's fluff that gives even more depth to the setting.

We also see our first example of how taverns are depicted; their signage doesn't include any words--we learn over the course of the Khaavren Romances that most people read, few can even do basic arithmetic, and the nobility class isn't supposed to get involved in philosophy--but instead has a graphic depiction. So our tavern here is called "The Three Forts" because its sign depicts three forts. Who knows? If one of those forts had been red, with the other two blue, it might have been called "The One and Two." This pattern of localized character comes up more in *The Viscount of Adrilankha* and in the later Vlad Taltos books.

Next, we're shown the political structure of fiefdom in the empire; the town is in a County, which is a Duchy, and the valley is split between that county and another. Questions of territory and power come up again and again in *The Phoenix Guards*, and are a key part of how the nobles compare themselves, their wealth, their prestige, their power, and even their disgrace.

We also see mention that the valley is known for its agricultural producs, and for the "distinctive" odor of its kethna farms. It's never fully explained quite what kethna are; they're described in cooking contexts like pigs, but they're also described as being roughly the size of cows. So perhaps imagine pigs that could flip over your car snuffling for truffles.

I also like the use of the term "distinctive" here; it's as though the author couldn't find the right word to describe it (there are *many* adjectives you could use to describe the odor of a livestock farm), and so leaves it to the reader to fill in the blank. That's a great tactic; why go to the trouble describing something when you can get the audience to do it themselves?

We learn about what's normal within a village:

> ...it had its inn, it had its leather-worker, it had its mill and bins. It had no sorcerer, but did have an augur and a healer. It had no steelbender, but did have a smith and wheelwright. It had no packing-house, but did have a smokehouse. It had no mayor, but did have its Speaker, with a low Speaker's House that was the only building of stone in the town. It had one street, that for half the year was mud and for the rest was the good, black soil of the district. It was near enough to the Imperial Highway that a coach came by the inn every morning and evening, but far enough away that it was a good refuge for the few bandits and highwaymen who dared to brave the wizards of the Athyra Guard, just lately retired with the turning of the Cycle from the Athyra to the Phoenix and with the ascension of the Emporor Tortallik.

Ok, we learn a *lot* about what's normal in a village. The idea of a "Speaker" is introduced here, but isn't really expanded on until later, in *Athyra*. We see mention of the turning of the Cycle, a key piece in the cosmology of the setting, and the major behind-the-scenes driver of activity in *Five Hundred years Later*.

Finally, we meet someone. As it turns out, it's our primary protagonist; Khaavren is to *The Phoenix Guards* as d'Artagnan is to *The Three Musketeers*.

First first mention of the nobles point

It's a thing at this point where it uses or they're drop a bunch of the different sub races of the setting and the audience isn't going to know anything about them and that's kind of interesting. They don't really say whether the I don't say that they're sub races. They say they just call them a thing. It could be a person who's a member of a gang or it could be a person who's a member of some other grouping. Although curiously in this setting being a member of a sub race and being a member of a game are not too dissimilar.

A game that only exists in the setting

They just introduced to xendra

This is also when they introduce magic in the setting in the form of an artifact that detects orb based magic now they don't mention or

Knows what she's about and that she's paying attention and is aware of her context or at least for surroundings

Alternates back and forth between different kinds of intelligence or obtuse this

Here we have our first instance of dialogue between two characters and it begins to illustrate the very long drawn-out pat

I'm not sure if the zendra named dropping lorde toro is supposed to be indicative of the culture of named dropping or if it's

Novels but it comes up a few times in the first book

The rules for imperial dueling

They are describing a rich they know that he is tall for a lien they also say he is wearing them braces

I think the duel scene was written with the idea that the hawklord might accuse Tazendra of cheating. Aerich's demanding they state the terms aloud, and then Tazendra's surprised disgust at the terms once stated...

It's worth going over the entire duel it's also worth noting this is a representation of an armed society is a polite society

They're characterizing Aerich's intense tranquility.

They're starting to point out that Khaavren is innocent, inexperienced and youthful.
