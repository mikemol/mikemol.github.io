Somewhat annoyed. If I try to use any theme but minima, I get just a couple of blank lines emitted to me by GitHub Pages. Research suggests that means a suppressed error message, but that...doesn't help me in the slightest. The usability isn't great, honestly.

I'm sure if I knew what I was doing with Jekyll and GH Pages, I wouldn't have had this problem. But I would have liked it if using the theme selector didn't result in a site that wouldn't render.

Whelp. Hopefully, I'll be able to write about the stuff I wanted to write about, tomorrow. Tonight, time for bed...
