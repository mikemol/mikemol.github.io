# Welcome.

I'm Mike Mol, a software engineer, SRE and systems architect who enjoys untangling complex problems in distributed systems.

With over 15 years of experience in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, and cloud infrastructure, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of challenging projects at companies like Google and Ford.

This blog is a space for me to explore the technical topics that I find interesting, from automation and CI/CD pipelines to the intersection of infrastructure and AI/ML. Here, you'll find my thoughts on various technologies, projects I'm working on, and the occasional "Mike Reads" or "Mike Writes" entry, where I delve into my other interests.

Feel free to look around and check out my [blog posts](./blog/index.md).
